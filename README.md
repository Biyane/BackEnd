1) Folder - DjangoChannels and FirstProject:<br>
was fully taken from [channels](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/index.html) and [django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/intro/)
2) charity - plain project was written with [DRF](https://www.django-rest-framework.org) and has default views such as: `login`, `logout` with `authorization`, `permission`.
